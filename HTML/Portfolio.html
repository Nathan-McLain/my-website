    <h2> First Computer </h2>

    Christmas morning is always a joy for a child. Waking up to the smell of breakfast, the plate of half-eaten
    cookies from Santa, and the glisten of lights from the tree creates a sense of excitement. The anticipation of
    opening presents is an experience that most people will remember. One Christmas day, I received the last few
    parts I was saving up for to finally build my first computer. I got the motherboard, CPU, and RAM that I had on
    my list for a few years, and I finally had everything I needed. As a young teen, I did not know exactly what to
    expect when putting all the parts together, but I knew that my research said all the parts were compatible.
    I started off by opening the AM3 compatible motherboard box. I carefully pulled out the CPU from its box and
    tried to put it on the board. The instructions warned me to be careful as the pins on AMD CPUs can easily be
    destroyed and rendered useless. Luckily, I noticed a small gold triangle on both the CPU and motherboard, which
    I lined up, and it snugly fit in. The next step was to put on the CPU cooler, and this part scared me. Thermal
    paste needed to be applied to the CPU, and then the cooler placed on top of that, latched, and then screwed
    down. I felt like I was putting a lot of force on the CPU and motherboard, but I had to trust what I was doing
    and slowly screw down the cooler and watch for any stress marks or listen for any breaking sounds.
    Next, I installed my RAM in the first two slots, as this motherboard had four slots, and it seemed logical to
    fill the first two. After that, I took the motherboard and placed it into the case. I started to screw it down
    when I realized that I needed to install a faceplate for the rear IO, which wasn't a part of the motherboard. I
    felt like I wasted time due to a simple mistake, and I always install the IO shield first thing so that I don't
    forget. After the IO shield was installed, and the motherboard was remounted to the case, I plugged in all the
    power cables and data cables for the hard drive. I learned that cable management was hard, and I didn't want to
    deal with it, so I did what all good techs do and shoved the extra cables into the hard drive bay. Everything
    was ready to go, so I closed the computer, plugged in my peripherals, and hit the power button. However, nothing
    was displayed on the screen. I did some troubleshooting and noticed that every other RAM slot was a different
    color. Slots 1 and 3 were black, and slots 2 and 4 were grey. I read the small, silk-screened print and found
    that for dual-channel memory, I needed to use slots 2 and 4. I made the change, and it worked!
    Looking back at this experience, I laugh now as most of the issues I ran into would never happen now as I have
    learned from my mistakes.

    <h2> Entering the Information systems program</h2>

    I have taken computer-based classes before taking information systems classes, but they were more math and
    physics based not application based. After taking my first CIS class, I felt like I was finally doing something
    that related to my degree and not just another intense math class. In the first few weeks of class, I began to
    enjoy working with operating systems, and learning new things. There was a whole other side of operating systems
    that I had never experienced before, and I found it fun to explore using Linux-based operating systems. It
    required knowledge of shorthand commands, proper ordering, and careful thought before you enter commands into
    the terminal. This is because one typo or incorrect syntax can cause unintended consequences such as deleting
    files or even corrupting the operating system itself.
    Enjoying what you do can not only be fun, but also increase productivity and have positive effects on your
    mental health. I worked full time while taking classes at Olympic College and I was stressed and didn’t perform
    to the best of my ability. I felt like I was taking two steps back for every step forward. Once I started taking
    classes I enjoyed, I started feeling less stressed, brought my grades back up, and started producing quality
    work in my assignments and at my Job. I am learning to identify the aspects of tasks that I enjoy or don't mind
    doing and focus on them to reduce stress and improve my performance. This has also helped me be more positive
    even when I don’t want to do something to create a positive work environment.
    Learning networking concepts has shown me that I enjoy understanding how networking systems work. Understanding
    the backbone of the network has helped me see how the larger world is interconnected, and how to break down
    complex systems into smaller parts to better understand how they work together. In networking, there is a lot of
    problem solving, and working together to find a solution that will not negatively impact the rest of your
    clients. I learned creative problem-solving techniques such as identifying the issue, troubleshooting, applying
    temporary fixes, monitoring client impact, and implementing permanent solutions without disrupting productivity
    or taking the network down. Not every problem is the same, taking this class helped me fine tune my
    problem-solving skills.

    <h2> Building my Home Network </h2>
    With my dad's help, we deployed our home network. As a cable technician with experience in many cable runs, my
    dad was an invaluable resource. Though we had existing cables in place, weather and pests had taken their toll,
    so we decided to replace them. This project required teamwork, communication, and technical know-how. Rather
    than settle for our existing Cat5e cables, we decided to upgrade to Cat6A cabling, which future-proofed our
    system for faster internet speeds and greater internal bandwidth. We also worked smarter, not harder, by tying
    the new cable to the old cables when we pulled them out, simplifying the process.
    In addition to the cable upgrade, I purchased new satellite hardware from a service provider called Starlink.
    This hardware replaced our old, slow DSL connection from CenturyLink. To ensure an unobstructed signal, we
    designed a pole mounting system and attached the dish to the pole. My dad climbed onto the roof while I helped
    lift the pole, temporarily mounting it to our deck for testing. Once we confirmed that the system worked and
    achieved speeds 100 times faster than before, we secured everything in place by attaching the pole to our deck
    and running guy wires for stability.
    After the installation, we had to configure the network on the software side. Using the knowledge gained from my
    classes, I was able to easily set up and configure our network to provide coverage throughout the house,
    maintain reliable and stable connections for all our devices, and ensure high levels of security to minimize the
    risk of attackers gaining access.
