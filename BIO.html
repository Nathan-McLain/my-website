            Nathan McLain is currently a student at Olympic College, studying information systems. He is pursuing a
            Bachelor of Applied Science in Information Systems (BAS-IS) through the college's 4-year transfer program
            and has maintained a GPA of 3.8 throughout his time at the college.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nathan has completed all prerequisite classes needed to enter the program and has obtained a Network Pro
            certification. He has been working with computers since the age of 12 and uses this knowledge to design,
            build, and repair computer systems for members of his community. He has diagnosed various issues with
            computer systems and applied fixes to ensure high-quality repair and client satisfaction.

        <p>
            Nathan's future goal is to become a systems administrator and help develop new ways for people to interact
            with computer systems. By attending the BAS-IS program, he hopes to gain the knowledge, experience, and
            skills needed to succeed in the information systems field.
