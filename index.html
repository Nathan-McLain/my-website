                <p>
                    My name is Nathan. I was born in San Francisco and moved to Washington when I was three years old. Since then, I have moved back and forth in Washington until my family settled in Belfair, where I live today. I went to North Mason High School and graduated with honors. I also participated in the Running Start program. I took a year off school and took a job as a personal banker, where I still work full time while taking classes. After this quarter, I am going into the Bachelors of Applied Sciences in Information Systems (BAS-IS) program. This class is one of the last prerequisites for the program that I need. After obtaining the BAS-IS, I would like to go into the networking or cybersecurity field as they are the most interesting to me at this time. Since I was young, I have always been interested in the mechanics behind how things work, and I believe that is what led me to where I am today and to be able to enjoy my hobbies. Taking Technical writing has helped me refine my skills in writing, look back at my academic and job history, and prepared me for future applications.
