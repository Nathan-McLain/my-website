            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p id="about">
                My name is Nathan. I was born in San Francisco and moved to Washington when I was three years old.
                Since then, I have moved back and forth in Washington until my family settled in Belfair, where I
                live today. I went to North Mason High School and graduated with honors. I also participated in the
                Running Start program. I took a year off school and took a job as a personal banker, where I still
                work full time while taking classes. After this quarter, I am going into the Bachelors of Applied
                Sciences in Information Systems (BAS-IS) program. This class is one of the last prerequisites for
                the program that I need. After obtaining the BAS-IS, I would like to go into the networking or
                cybersecurity field as they are the most interesting to me at this time. Since I was young, I have
                always been interested in the mechanics behind how things work, and I believe that is what led me to
                where I am today and to be able to enjoy my hobbies. Taking Technical writing has helped me refine
                my skills in writing, look back at my academic and job history, and prepared me for future
                applications.

            <h3> About My website</h3>

            <p>
                This website is designed to explain more about me and show my skills and experience with
                computer-information-systems. I am still new to the Information systems world so I dont have much work
                experience, but I am able to learn quickly
                and have relivant experience. Some of this relivant experience includes, computer building, networking,
                and troubleshooting.
